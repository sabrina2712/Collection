# Negotiation

> This is not an interview it is a negotiation!

Or to put it differently, both side interview each other.

## 1. Everything can be negotiated!

- money
- vacation days
- work time (40h,35h, 32h etc)
- laptop also for privat use

## 2. How much should I ask for?

Do the calculation!

You know best how much you need do the calculation to know your minimum.

## 3. But then negotiate

Hypothetical scenario, you calculation for a minimum is 2400 so you would like to have 2700 for a good live. Then you should start the negotiation with 3100 or 3000. Like this you leave room for the negotiation.

It has a positive effect for the other side if they could reduce the price and it leaves you in favor to renegotiate other factors, like: raise after 6mth or other conditions.

Make it depend on your responsibilities.

Start the negotiation but don't start with the price!

> I'm new to this industrie can you give me the range for this position.

## 4. Ask Questions!

Interview Them!

Hiring is not fun for both sides.

Some of the questions you can ask:

- How big is my team?

Sneaky Onboarding:

- ask so many questions that it feels like the onboarding is done
- comp: well he/she is already onboarded let's go with that person

## 5. Be the solution

People don't hire knowledge the hire attitude.

> I learned a lot, and i can't wait to focus with you guys.

## 6. Coding Challenge

It's not the solution but the approach.
