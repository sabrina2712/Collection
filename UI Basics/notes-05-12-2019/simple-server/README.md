# Bootstrap

You will need first to install all the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

After this, start watching the sass folder:

```bash
npm run watch-styles
```

Remember, watch is only going to compile changes you added after you started the command. 
To trigger the compilation, you can go make a small changes or just save the file.
Otherwise, you can use the `build-styles` command once before you start the `watch-styles` command.
